Marionberry
The marionberry (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus) is a cultivar of blackberry developed by the USDA ARS breeding program in cooperation with Oregon State University. A cross between the 'Chehalem' and 'Olallie' varieties, it is the most common form of blackberry cultivated. It accounts for over half of all blackberries produced in Oregon.
