Olallieberry
The olallieberry ( OH-l…ô-lee-berr-ee), sometimes spelled ollalieberry, olallaberry, olalliberry, ollalaberry or ollaliberry, is the marketing name for the 'Olallie' blackberry released by the USDA-ARS (in collaboration with Oregon State University). The berry was a selection from a cross between the 'Black Logan' (syn. 'Mammoth'), developed by Judge James Logan in California, and the youngberry, which was developed by Byrnes M. Young in Louisiana. 
According to Judge Logan, 'Black Logan' was a cross between the eastern blackberry 'Crandall' and the western dewberry 'Aughinbaugh'. 'Youngberry' was from 'Phenomenal' x 'Austin Mayes'. 'Phenomenal' in turn is a cross of the 'Aughinbaugh' western dewberry and 'Cuthbert' red raspberry and so has a similar background to Logan's 'Loganberry' because it shares a parent.
