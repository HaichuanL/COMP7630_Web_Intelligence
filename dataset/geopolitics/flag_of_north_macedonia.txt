Flag of North Macedonia
The flag of North Macedonia is the national flag of the Republic of North Macedonia and depicts a stylized yellow sun on a red field, with eight broadening rays extending from the center to the edge of the field. It was created by Miroslav Grƒçev and was adopted on 5 October 1995.
The eight-rayed sun represents the "new sun of Liberty" referred to in "Denes nad Makedonija" ("Today over Macedonia"), the national anthem of North Macedonia.
The first post-Yugoslav flag of the country, adopted in 1992, known as the Kutlesh Flag, featured the Vergina Sun, a symbol that had been discovered at Aigai, the first capital and burial ground of the ancient kings of Macedon. Greece considers the Vergina Sun to be a Greek symbol and imposed a year-long economic embargo in order to persuade the then Republic of Macedonia to remove it from its flag, resulting in the current design.
