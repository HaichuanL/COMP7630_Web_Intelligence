Dogberry
Dogberry is a character created by William Shakespeare for his play Much Ado About Nothing. He is described by The Nuttall Encyclop√¶dia as a "self-satisfied night constable" with an inflated view of his own importance as the leader of a group of comically bumbling police watchmen. Dogberry is notable for his numerous malapropisms, which sometimes are referred to as "dogberryisms" or "dogberrys" after him. The Dogberry character was created for William Kempe, who played comic roles in Shakespeare's theatre company the Lord Chamberlain's Men.
