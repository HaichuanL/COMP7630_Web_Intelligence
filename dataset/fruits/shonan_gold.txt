Shonan Gold
Shonan Gold (湘南ゴールド) is a hybrid Japanese citrus, with a characteristic "golden" bright yellow color.
Though not completely seedless, the seeds are few in number. The yellowness is inherited from its mother plant (seed parent), a small-sized variety known as Ōgonkan or "Golden Orange", which has been crossed with the Imamura unshiu variety of satsuma orange for size and other desired traits.  The cultivar was developed by an agricultural experiment station run by the Kanagawa Prefecture.
