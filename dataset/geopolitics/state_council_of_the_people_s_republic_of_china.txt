State Council of the People's Republic of China
The State Council, constitutionally synonymous with the Central People's Government since 1954 (particularly in relation to local governments), is the chief administrative authority of the People's Republic of China. It is chaired by the premier and includes the heads of each of the constituent departments (ministries). Currently, the council has 35 members: the premier, one executive vice premier, three other vice premiers, five state councilors (of whom three are also ministers and one is also the secretary-general), and 26 in charge of the Council's constituent departments. The State Council directly oversees provincial-level People's Governments, and in practice maintains membership with the top levels of the CCP. Aside from very few non-CCP ministers, members of the State Council are also members of the CCP's Central Committee.
