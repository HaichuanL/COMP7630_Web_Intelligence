Sea buckthorn oil
Sea buckthorn oil is a red-orange oil derived from sea buckthorn plants. The most commonly used species for this purpose is Hippophae rhamnoides. Species belonging to this genus accumulate lipids in the mesocarp (the fruit pulp), so the oil can be extracted from either the seeds or the pulp. 
The resulting oils (seed oil and pulp oil, also called fruit or berry oil) are used in dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, cosmetics and skin care products.
