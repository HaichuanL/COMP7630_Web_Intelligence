It held important trade relations with Portugal during the last centuries before being captured, sacked and burnt in 1897 by a British punitive expedition. Many bronze sculptures in Benin City palace, collectively termed the Benin Bronzes, were taken by the British who followed up their victory by gradually colonizing the area, eventually incorporating the region into Colonial Nigeria.The indigenous people of Benin City are the Edo people (the Benin People), and they speak the Edo language or Bini Language.
