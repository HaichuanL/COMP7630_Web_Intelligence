Physalis peruviana
Physalis peruviana is a species of plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It is commonly known as Cape gooseberry, goldenberry or ground cherry, as poha in Hawaii, and as Harankash in Egypt, while in its countries of origin it is called aguaymanto, uvilla or uchuva, in addition to numerous indigenous and regional names.
The history of P. peruviana cultivation in South America can be traced to the Inca Empire. It has been cultivated in England since the late 18th century, and in South Africa in the Cape of Good Hope since at least the start of the 19th century. Widely introduced in the 20th century, P. peruviana is now cultivated or grows wild across the world in temperate and tropical regions.
