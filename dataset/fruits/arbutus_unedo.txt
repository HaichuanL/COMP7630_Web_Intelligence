Arbutus unedo
Arbutus unedo is an evergreen shrub or small tree in the family Ericaceae, native to the Mediterranean region and western Europe. The tree is well known for its fruit, the arbutus berry, which bear some resemblance to the strawberry â€” hence the common name "strawberry tree". However, it is not closely related to true strawberries of the genus Fragaria.
Its presence in Ireland also lends it the name "Irish strawberry tree", or cain, or cane apple (from the Irish name for the tree, caithne), or sometimes "Killarney strawberry tree". The strawberry tree is the national tree of Italy because of its green leaves, its white flowers and its red berries, colors that recall the Italian flag.
