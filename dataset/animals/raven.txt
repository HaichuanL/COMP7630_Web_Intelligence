Raven
A raven is any of several larger-bodied bird species of the genus Corvus. These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus. There is no consistent distinction between "crows" and "ravens", common names which are assigned to different species chiefly based on their size.
The largest raven species are the common raven and the thick-billed raven.
