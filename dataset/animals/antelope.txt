Antelope
The term antelope is used to refer to many species of even-toed ruminant that are indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia.
The term “antelope” is a wastebasket taxon and is defined as comprising any of numerous Old World grazing and browsing hoofed mammals belonging to the family Bovidae of the order Artiodactyla.A stricter definition, also known as the "true antelopes," includes only the genera Gazella, Nanger, Eudorcas, and Antilope. One North American species, the pronghorn, is colloquially referred to as the "American antelope," but it belongs to a different family from the African and Eurasian antelopes.
A group of antelope is called a herd. Unlike deer antlers, which are shed and grown annually, antelope horns grow continuously.
