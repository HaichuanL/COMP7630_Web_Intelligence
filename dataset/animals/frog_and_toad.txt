Frog and Toad
Frog and Toad is a series of easy-reader children's books, written and illustrated by Arnold Lobel. 
Each book contains five simple, often humorous, sometimes poignant, short stories chronicling the exploits of an anthropomorphic frog and toad, named Frog and Toad respectively. The situations in which they find themselves are a cross between the human and animal worlds. Some of their adventures include attempting to fly a kite, cleaning Toad's dirty house, and finding out different reasons for isolation.  
Frog is taller with a green shade, and is more cheery and relaxed than Toad; Toad is shorter and stout with a brown shade, and while just as caring and friendly as Frog, is also the more serious and uptight of the duo.
