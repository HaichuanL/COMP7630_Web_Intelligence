Loganberry
The loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) is a hybrid of the North American blackberry (Rubus ursinus) and the European raspberry (Rubus idaeus).The plant and the fruit resemble the blackberry more than the raspberry, but the fruit color is a dark red, rather than black as in blackberries. Loganberries – which were an accident of berry breeding by James Harvey Logan, for whom they are named – are cultivated commercially and by gardeners.
