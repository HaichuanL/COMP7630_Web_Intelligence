Salmon (color)
Salmon is a range of pinkish-orange to light pink colors, named after the color of salmon flesh.
The first recorded use of salmon as a color name in English was in 1776.The actual color of salmon flesh varies from almost white to light orange, depending on their levels of the carotenoid astaxanthin due to how rich a diet of krill and shrimp the fish feeds on; salmon raised on fish farms are given non-synthetic or artificial coloring in their food.
