Crow
A crow (pronounced ) is a bird of the genus Corvus, or more broadly a synonym for all of Corvus. Crows are generally black in colour. The word "crow" is used as part of the common name of many species. The related term "raven" is not pinned scientifically to any certain trait, but is rather a general grouping for larger Corvus spp.
